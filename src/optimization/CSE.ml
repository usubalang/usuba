                                    CSE.ml

     Common Subexpression Elimination (CSE) is yet another very common
     optimization that consists in replacing common expressions by
     variables containing their values.
     Typically,

        x = a ^ b
        y = a ^ b

     Is replaced by

        x = a ^ b
        y = x

     (and then, y can probably be removed altogether and x be used
     instead. This is done by the module Copy_propagation)


     Nothing too fancy is going one here: we go through each expression
     of the program while maintaining a hash table { expr : variable list }
     that contains every expression already available, and the variables
     that contains its result. Note the "variable list" and not
     "variable": this is because of function calls, that can compute
     several values. Note that removing function calls is only valid
     because functions are pure and stateless.


     We need to be a bit careful with loops. For instance, consider:

       forall i in [1, 3] { x[i] = y[i] ^ z[i] }
       forall i in [4, 6] { x[i] = y[i] ^ z[i] }

     It would be wrong for this module to replace the second loop's body
     with `x[i] = x[i]` (even though the previous loop was already
     computing `y[i] ^ z[i]` and putting the result in `x[i]`...).
     This is handled by passing a copy of the expression environment to
     the reccursive calls that performs CSE inside loops body.
     Note that this can result in some CSE not being performed because
     Usuba doesn't do loop-invariant code motion yet. This shouldn't
     matter too much for now though.
     TODO: add a loop-invariant code motion pass.
